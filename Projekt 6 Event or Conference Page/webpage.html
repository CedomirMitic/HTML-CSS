                          With the idea of imparting programming
                          knowledge, Mr. Sandeep Jain, an IIT
                          Roorkee alumnus started a dream,
                          GeeksforGeeks. Whether programming
                          excites you or you feel stifled,
                          wondering how to prepare for
                          interview questions or
                          how to ace data structures and
                          algorithms, GeeksforGeeks is a
                          one-stop solution. With every
                          tick of time, we are adding arrows
                          in our quiver. From articles on
                          various computer science subjects
                          to programming problems for practice,
                          from basic to premium courses, from
                          technologies to entrance examinations,
                          we have been building ample content
                          with superior quality. In a short
                          span, we have built a community of
                          1 Million+ Geeks around the world, 20,000+
                          Contributors and 500+ Campus Ambassadors
                          in various colleges across the nation.
                          Our success stories include a lot of
                          students who benefitted in their
                          placements and landed jobs at tech
                          giants. Our vision is to build a gigantic
                          network of geeks and we are only a
                          fraction of it yet.
