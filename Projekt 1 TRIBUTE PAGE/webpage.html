      <article class="">
        Jack Sparrow was a legendary pirate of the Seven Seas, and the irreverent trickster of the Caribbean. A captain of equally dubious morality and sobriety, a master of self-promotion and self-interest, Jack fought a constant and losing battle with his own best tendencies while living a pirate's life. He was the quickest to seize the moment and make it his own. Whether by cause or accident was a matter of debate, but the results were the same and always different. Captain Jack's first love was the sea, his second, his beloved ship the Black Pearl.

        The son of Captain Edward Teague, Jack was born on a pirate ship in a typhoon. Before he became known as "Captain Jack Sparrow" he was simply known as Jack Sparrow, a teenage stowaway who, even then, had a desire for adventure. Young Jack first sailed on the Barnacle with a ragtag crew on a quest to locate and procure the legendary Sword of Cortés. A few years after his teenage adventures, an encounter with the infamous rogue pirates forced Jack to abandon the pirate life and take employment in the East India Trading Company. After five years of faithful service, during which he sailed across all the Seven Seas, he was given command of the Wicked Wench, a ship owned by Cutler Beckett, the EITC Director for West Africa. As Beckett's employee, Sparrow searched for the mystical island of Kerma and its treasure, until he decided to betray Beckett and keep the island and its inhabitants safe from Beckett and his slave traders. When Beckett ordered him to transport a cargo of slaves to the Bahamas, promising to sell him the Wench for just one shilling, Sparrow chose to liberate them instead and stole the Wench from Beckett. However, Beckett's men managed to find Jack and branded him as a pirate, irrevocably returning Sparrow to a life of piracy, while the Wench was set aflame and sunk. After striking a bargain with the fearsome Davy Jones, the ghastly captain of the ghostly Flying Dutchman, in which his beloved vessel was raised from the depths, Jack had the Wicked Wench renamed the Black Pearl and began the pirate life anew. At some point, Jack Sparrow became one of the nine Pirate Lords, his domain being the Caribbean Sea.

          The Black Pearl was built by the French and was originally a merchant ship called Wicked Wench (the name of the ship from the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disneyland Park, which is shown shelling a fort), but its crew later turned to piracy under the command of a pirate captain named Morgan, who was killed during a battle with Spanish Royal Navy Captain Armando Salazar. The helmsman, Jack Sparrow, was granted captaincy of the Wicked Wench after out-manoeuvring Salazar and saving the crew during battle.[1]

Years later, the Wicked Wench became registered to the East India Trading Company and owned by Cutler Beckett, the EITC Director for West Africa. At the time, Jack Sparrow was in the employ of the East India Trading Company and regained captaincy of the Wicked Wench (this fits in with reality as history notes that pirates did not build ships specifically to commit piracy. Instead, they either bought or stole small, fast vessels and then retrofitted them with heavy armaments).

      Joshamee Gibbs was the longtime comrade and devoted First Mate of Captain Jack Sparrow. Teller of tales, handy with a bottle, this veteran sea dog was truly a skillful sailor who cleverly navigated his way through many deadly situations. The often-soused but always reliable Gibbs had an encyclopedic knowledge in all manner of pirate lore of the seven seas and an epicurean taste for rum.
      Once a sailor in His Majesty's Royal Navy, and later an enthusiastic pirate, Joshamee Gibbs was a man who knew his way across every ocean, and into every pub. Gibbs was Jack Sparrow's most trusted comrade, one who cared as much about the Black Pearl as Jack himself did. On several occasions, Gibbs served under Jack's nemesis and rival, Hector Barbossa, but was never truly loyal to him compared to his true loyalty to Jack.

      <article> William Turner, Jr., better known as William or Will Turner, was the only child of William "Bootstrap Bill" Turner and his unnamed wife. In his life, Will Turner was an accomplished blacksmith by trade, an excellent swordsman by pursuit and a budding pirate by fate. After embarking on several adventures with Captain Jack Sparrow, Will embraced his pirate heritage as he pursued his own purposes. Despite Will's best efforts to adhere to the social class structure, he realizes that some rules are meant to be broken.
      Born in Glasgow, Scotland, Will was raised by his mother in England and believed his father was a respectable merchant sailor. When his mother died, Will began searching for his father while wearing a gold medallion. Rescued from a burning shipwreck, Will first met Elizabeth Swann aboard the HMS Dauntless.

         Elizabeth Turner (née Swann) was the daughter of Governor Weatherby Swann. With an adventurous spirit and the need to break social boundaries, she had long been fascinated with the freewheeling world of buccaneers to a point of learning a song about pirates as a child. Over the years, Elizabeth blossomed into a beautiful young lady, though was never satisfied with the affluent, domestic life she had been born into. Both Jack Sparrow and Will Turner change Elizabeth's notions of romance and adventure forever, soon learning that all the rules she believed in are meant to be broken.
      Born in London, England, Elizabeth led a fairly sheltered life of privilege throughout her childhood. Since the death of his wife, Governor Swann had raised his daughter on his own.

        Jack the Monkey, or simply Jack, was the second pet monkey owned by the black-hearted Captain Hector Barbossa. Mockingly named after Captain Jack Sparrow, this capuchin monkey was considered the meanest, most rotten-tempered simian in all of the Caribbean. Jack the Monkey first joined his owner in a search to find of the cursed treasure of Cortés, which Jack lived under throughout his life as an undead monkey.
        Following the battle of Isla de Muerta, Jack somehow returned to the civilization and joined the Black Pearl's new crew, commanded by Sparrow. However, he didn't accompany Sparrow and his crew during the rest of the quest for the Dead Man's Chest, because he decided to stay in Tia Dalma's shack along his now resurrected master.
